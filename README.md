Origami Project Goals

- Lowest barrier of entry to Image Processing, Computer Vision and Neural Networks on the JVM
  - by using OpenCV (and when possible Clojure)
- Works out of the box on your device (OSX, Windows, Linux, Raspberry, Jetson ..) and in your language (Clojure, Java, Kotlin, Scala, Binary via Google's Bazel)

# news

- (Better!) Documentation has moved .. [here](http://origamidocs.hellonico.info/).
- [codox](https://github.com/weavejester/codox) generated API is [here](http://origamidocs.hellonico.info/codox/index.html)
- Supports for [OpenCV 4.3](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog#version430) 
- Ready to use jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/hellonico/origami-fun/tree/master/jupyter)
- Deep Neural Networks with [origami-dnn](https://github.com/hellonico/origami-dnn)
- Run on [AWS Lambdas](https://github.com/hellonico/origami-aws-lambdas)
- Real-time Streaming Server [App](https://github.com/hellonico/opencv-live-video-stream-over-http) 
- With [origami-sources](https://github.com/hellonico/origami-sources/)
  - use various sources (folders, zip files, dropbox, webcam, flickr etc..) to lazily load OpenCV Mat objects
  - use various handlers (You Tube, HTTPS etc...) to load VideoCapture objects
